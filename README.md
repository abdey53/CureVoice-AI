# CureVoice-AI

## 🧠 What is CureVoice-AI  
CureVoice-AI is a voice-based diagnostic assistant (or medical-voice processing tool) that — *explain briefly what it does* (e.g. converts patient voice to text, analyses symptoms, gives suggestions or routes to doctor, etc.).  

## Why this project / Motivation  
- *Explain here what problem you’re solving.*  
- Maybe patients find it hard to explain symptoms, or remote diagnosis, voice-based accessibility, etc.  
- CureVoice-AI tries to bridge that gap by …  

## 🔧 Technologies / Tools Used  
- Python  
- (list libraries, e.g. Gradio / PyAudio / any ML or voice-processing library)  
- (If there is any front-end / JS / Svelte / Web interface — list them)  
- (Any other relevant tools / platforms)  

## 🚀 How to Install & Run Locally  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdey53/CureVoice-AI.git  
cd CureVoice-AI  
# Install dependencies  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
# or if you use Pipfile

```  

*(You may need to mention OS requirements, Python version etc.)*

## 🎯 How to Use / What to Test  

- Upload or record a voice file (e.g. patient describing symptoms)  
- Run the app — it will process audio, produce text/analysis (or whatever your output is)  
- (If you have sample audio files in repo — mention them, e.g. `patient_voice_test.mp3`)  
- Show example inputs and outputs
